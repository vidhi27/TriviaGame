# TriviaGame

Trivia game is created using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML

This trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time's up.

If the player selects the correct answer, correct image for the answer will come up. After few seconds, the next question will be displayed--without user input

If the player selects the wrong answer or runs out of time, they will be told about the wrong selection or time's up and the correct answer will be displayed without the image. Again after few seconds, the next question will be displayed.

On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game is shown (without reloading the page).
